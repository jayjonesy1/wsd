			<section id="two">
			
				<article><p>Starting in 1963 on <strong>BBC</strong> in the United Kingdom, featuring a man known only as The Doctor. He is a timelord from the planet Gallifrey. The Doctor travels through time and space in his machine the TARDIS, Time and Relative Dimension in Space. The Doctor travels through periods of time on earth and on other planets, meeting humans and aliens. Some he even keeps as a companion to travel with him. The Doctor is essentially just a man travelling to see the universe and he ends up helping people and saving the world from bad situations. The Doctor has lived a long time and has been killed by different means quite a few times. When The Doctor dies, his body regenerates into a new form. He keeps his memories and knowledge and experiences but gains a new personality and a new look. So far there has been 11 different Doctors with a 12th just recently announced.</p></article>
